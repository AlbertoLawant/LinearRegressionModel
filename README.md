# 🎢 Rollercoaster Popularity Prediction using Linear Regression

This project uses historical rollercoaster data to predict a synthetic "popularity score" based on physical and categorical ride attributes. It demonstrates a complete, production-style machine learning workflow using **Python**, **pandas**, **scikit-learn**, and **Jupyter Notebooks**.

## 📌 Highlights

✅ End-to-end data science pipeline  
✅ Clean modular structure (`src/` and `notebooks/`)  
✅ Data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation  
✅ Visual pipeline representation in Jupyter  
✅ Production-grade code that’s reusable and scalable

## 🧠 Project Motivation

Rollercoasters are exciting engineering feats, but which features make them more “popular”?  
While real popularity data isn't available, we simulate it using a weighted formula combining ride speed, height, number of inversions, and G-force. This lets us focus on building and evaluating a real regression pipeline.
